The school has made learning a pleasurable experience which has proved through academic as well as sports excellence.As ‘Samata’ stands for ‘Equality’, we always believe in it while transforming qualities into student’s all over development and making them ‘Global Learners’. It is rightly said “Success comes to those who work hard and stays with those who don’t rest on the laurels of the past.” Education is a life-long learning process. Learning happens all the time; not only in a pre-designated place called the school. The home’s and school’s mission therefore is to provide a learning environment and opportunities to the children as the learners shaping young, impressionable minds is one of life’s biggest challenges. At Samata International School, we aim to empower our students to grow as individuals with strong open discerning minds with an international perspective, preparing them to make a mark in the global village, with our vision “Making Learners Global”. Samta’s Hostel “The home away from home” plays crucial role in shaping life of the students.I feel proud to express that the school is performing extremely well in all the aspects to ensure academic and human excellence.The clear vision of the management, the systematic approach and implementation of the activities by the administration, commitment and dedication of the teaching and non-teaching staff, cooperation of parents and the hard work of the students, together has given new identity to our school. Our journey towards excellence continues..!!</p>
